# pylaunch

## How to run
this is a beta meaning that you will have to run this on a local server

to run on a local server you have to have python and the Flask library installed

in the same directory as main.py type "python3 main.py" and click on the server link or type "127.0.0.1:5000"
this will bring to the home at the moment I have only worked on the intro "127.0.0.1:5000/intro"
